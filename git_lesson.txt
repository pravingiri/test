1.What is DevOps?
-DevOps id a culture that allows devlopment and Operations team to work  together
-Developers  continuouslty develop and test codes
-There is continuously integration taking place thourgh out the lifecycle
-Operations team continuosly deploy the codes to the  production environment
-Allows better collaboration, increased trust and faster software releases

2.Tools in DevOps:
Subversion (SVN), TFS  and Git  are  Source Code  Management  or Software Configuration Management tools (SCM) used for both planning and coding of the software.

3.Source Code Management Tools
SVN
-SVN is a centralized version control system
-it is distributed under the open source license
-it allows you to recover older versions of your data or examine how your  data changes

TFS
-TFS is a centralized source control tool like SVN
-it is distributed under the Trailware license
-TFS is an application lifecycle management solution that does issue tracking and document  management

Git
-Git is a distributed  version control tool
-it is distributed under  the  GNU  license
-Git is  a used for maintaining  historical and current versions  of source code. web pages, etc

3.Version control system 
-The diagram shows tare 3 files in the local system 
-A snapshot of these files are stored in the remote respository as Version 1  
-Now,  there has been some changes to file 2.1.This change is stored as version 2 in the repository
-VCS allows you to track the history of a collection of files 

-Each version captures  a snapshot of the VCS allows you to switch between these versions


4.Centralized Vs Distributed Version Control System
a.Centralized version control system
-it uses a central  server to store all the files
-Every operation is performed directly on the repository
-All the versions of the file are stored on the Center VCS server
-In case the central server crashes, entire data of the project will be lost.Hence,Distributed VCS was introduced
b.Distributed Version Control System
-every programmer has a copy of all the versions of the code on their local system
-Distributed VCS moves from the client-server approach of Central VCS to peer-to-peer approach
-they can update their local repositories with new data from the central server and changes gets reflected to the main repository
-Git is one such distributed VCS tool

5.What is git?
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files. it is generally used for source code management in software development.
-Git is used to track changes in the source code
-Distributed version control tool used for source code management 
-Allows multiple developers to work together
-Supports non-linear development because of its thousands of parallel branches

6.Features of git
-tracks history
-free and open source
-supports non-linear development
-creates backup
-scalable
-supports collaboration
-branching  is easier
-distributed development

7.Workflow of Git
-made 1st diagram in notebook.
-made 2nd diagram in notebook
-git workflow in 3-stage
	a.stage the files, add snapshots of them to your staging area.
	b.do a commit that stores the snapshots permanently to your git directory.
	c.checkout any existing version, make changes, stage them and commit.

8.Branch in Git
-branch in git is used to keep your changes until they are ready
-you  can  do your work on a branch while the main branch (master) remains stable. After you are done with your are done with your work,you can merge it to the main branch

9.Commands in Git
Create repositories
	-git init
Make change
	-add
	-commmit
	-status
Sync repositories
	-push
	-pull
	-add origin
Parallal development
	-branch
	-mearge
	-rebase
